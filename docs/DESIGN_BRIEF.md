# Design Brief: Kanso Identity & Logo Design

## 1. Project Overview

**Product Name**: Kanso (Selected Direction)
_Pronunciation_: kahn-so
_Meaning_: "Simplicity" (Japanese). One of the seven principles of Zen aesthetics, focusing on the elimination of clutter and the non-essential.

**Elevator Pitch**: A high-fidelity, personal productivity suite that unifies Deep Focus (Pomodoro), Structured Work (Tasks), and Visual Planning (Calendar). It is a "Radical Minimalist" alternative to cluttered tools, designed to help users reach a state of flow.

## 2. Core Philosophy: The Zen of Productivity

Our identity is built on three pillars of Japanese design philosophy that solve modern digital overwhelm.

### Kanso (簡素) — "Simplicity"

_The elimination of clutter._
We strip away non-essential features, decorations, and choices. If it doesn't help you focus, it doesn't exist. This is the **Structure** (The Lattice).

### Ma (間) — "Negative Space"

_The space between things._
In Kanso, white space is not empty—it's active. It creates the breathing room necessary for focus. We don't fill every pixel; we protect the void. This determines our **Layout** rhythm.

### Seijaku (静寂) — "Energized Calm"

_Tranquility in the midst of activity._
Focus is not about stopping; it's about flowing without friction. Our interactions should feel quiet, dampened, and deliberate—like a stone garden, not a busy street. This defines our **Interaction** design.

## 3. Visual Archetypes: Zen-Modernism

We are blending the strict utility of **Swiss Design** with the organic imperfection of **Wabi-Sabi** and the bold iconography of **Manga Apps** (Mihon, Tachiyomi).

### The Aesthetic

- **Radical Minimalism**: Info-dense but calm (Notion/Linear).
- **Paper, Not Glass**: Matte textures, distinct borders, no blurred overlays.
- **God-Tier Typography**: Tracking-heavy sans-serifs that feel like editorial print.
- **Kanji DNA**: Design logic derived from the strokes of 簡素.

## 4. Logo Concepts: The "K" Glyph

We need a symbol that feels like a modern tool but carries the weight of a traditional seal (Hanko).

### Concept A: "The Shodo K" (Calligraphic)

_Inspiration: Mihon, Tachiyomi_
A bold, geometric abstraction of the letter "K" treated as a Kanji character.

- **Visual**: Heavy, ink-like strokes with sharp terminals.
- **Metaphor**: The balance between the rigid vertical spine (Logic) and the expressive diagonal strokes (Flow).
- **Vibe**: Iconic, "Manga Reader" aesthetic, identifiable at small sizes.

### Concept B: "The Detached K" (Ma)

_Inspiration: Karesansui (Zen Gardens)_
A "K" constructed from three separate, floating elements that never touch.

- **Visual**: A vertical pill (Calendar), a detached ascending dot (Focus), and a detached descending stroke (Tasks).
- **Metaphor**: The "Ma" (gap) in the center represents the space for clear thinking.
- **Vibe**: Ethereal, technical, precise.

### Concept C: "The Bamboo Lattice"

_Inspiration: The 'Bamboo' radical in 簡_
An abstract grid pattern that forms a subtle "K" or hexagonal structure.

- **Visual**: Intersecting lines reminiscent of woven bamboo or a bento grid.
- **Metaphor**: The strong, flexible structure that holds your day together.
- **Vibe**: Structuralist, secure, architectural.

## 5. Interaction Rituals

How the app _feels_ is as important as how it looks.

- **The Ratchet**: Time pickers and scrolls should feel like a mechanical watch complication—precise, audible clicks (haptics).
- **Spring Physics**: Animations should not be linear. They should carry momentum and "settle" like physical objects (Seijaku).
- **The Bow**: Respectful disclosure. Information (like edit buttons) bows out of the way until needed (hover states).

## 6. Inspiration Board

- **Linear**: For the high-density utility and "Zen-Modernism (Kanso)" quality of interactions.
- **Notion**: For the clean, monochrome, content-first approach.
- **Cosmos settings**: For the feeling of a "Universe" of thought and Ma-driven layout.
- **Zen Gardens (Karesansui)**: For the interplay of rock (structure) and raked sand (flow).

## 7. Deliverables

- **Logo Concepts**: 3 distinct directions (Abstract, Geometric, Typographic).
- **App Icon Construction**: How it sits in a squircle.
- **Monochrome Version**: Must work in single-color black or white.
